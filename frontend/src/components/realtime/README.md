# Real-time Dashboard and Collaboration Interface

This directory contains the implementation of the real-time dashboard and collaboration interface for Ticolops, as specified in task 7.2.

## Components

### Core Components

1. **RealtimeDashboard** - Main dashboard component that orchestrates all real-time features
2. **ActivityFeed** - Displays real-time activity events from team members
3. **TeamPresence** - Shows current status and presence of team members
4. **ConflictAlerts** - Displays merge conflicts and collaboration issues
5. **CollaborationSuggestions** - Suggests collaboration opportunities based on team activity
6. **ConnectionStatus** - Shows WebSocket connection status

### Features Implemented

#### ✅ Real-time Activity Dashboard with WebSocket Integration
- Live activity feed showing commits, deployments, and collaboration events
- Real-time updates via WebSocket connection
- Activity filtering and pagination
- Connection status monitoring

#### ✅ Team Presence Visualization and Status Indicators
- Live team member presence tracking
- Status indicators (online, away, busy, offline)
- Current project and file tracking
- Idle detection and automatic status updates

#### ✅ Conflict Detection Display and Collaboration Suggestions
- Real-time conflict alerts for merge conflicts, file locks, and simultaneous edits
- Severity-based conflict prioritization
- Collaboration opportunity suggestions based on related work
- Interactive suggestion acceptance and dismissal

#### ✅ Integration Tests for Real-time UI Updates and WebSocket Connectivity
- Comprehensive test suite covering all real-time features
- WebSocket integration testing
- UI update testing with mock real-time data
- Connection failure handling tests

## Architecture

### WebSocket Integration
The real-time features are built on top of a robust WebSocket service that handles:
- Connection management with automatic reconnection
- Event-based communication (activities, presence, conflicts)
- Room-based collaboration (projects and files)
- Heartbeat system for presence detection

### State Management
Real-time state is managed through the `RealtimeContext` which provides:
- Connection status tracking
- Activity history management (limited to 50 items)
- User presence tracking
- Conflict alert management
- Collaboration suggestion handling

### Layout Flexibility
The dashboard supports multiple layout modes:
- **Grid Layout** - Default 2x2 grid layout for balanced view
- **Sidebar Layout** - Activity feed on left, presence and suggestions on right
- **Compact Layout** - Condensed view for smaller screens

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests** - Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests** - WebSocket service integration
- **End-to-End Tests** - Complete dashboard workflow testing
- **Real-time Update Tests** - Live data update verification

### Test Files
- `RealtimeDashboard.test.tsx` - Main dashboard component tests
- `WebSocketIntegration.test.tsx` - WebSocket service integration tests
- `CollaborationSuggestions.test.tsx` - Collaboration features tests
- `integration.test.tsx` - Full dashboard integration tests
- Existing component tests for ActivityFeed, TeamPresence, etc.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```tsx
import { RealtimeDashboard } from './components/realtime/RealtimeDashboard';

function App() {
  return (
    <RealtimeProvider>
      <RealtimeDashboard 
        layout="grid"
        showStats={true}
        maxItems={{
          activities: 10,
          presence: 12,
          conflicts: 5,
          suggestions: 4,
        }}
      />
    </RealtimeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Layout Switching
```tsx
const [layout, setLayout] = useState<'grid' | 'sidebar' | 'compact'>('grid');

return (
  <RealtimeDashboard 
    layout={layout}
    showStats={layout !== 'compact'}
  />
);
```

### Custom Configuration
```tsx
<RealtimeDashboard 
  layout="sidebar"
  showStats={false}
  maxItems={{
    activities: 20,
    presence: 15,
    conflicts: 10,
    suggestions: 6,
  }}
/>
```

## Real-time Events

### Activity Events
- `commit` - Code commits
- `deployment` - Deployment status updates
- `collaboration` - Team collaboration events
- `conflict` - Conflict detection
- `presence` - Presence changes

### Presence Status
- `online` - Actively working
- `busy` - Working on specific file
- `away` - Idle for >5 minutes
- `offline` - Disconnected

### Conflict Types
- `merge_conflict` - Git merge conflicts
- `file_lock` - File editing conflicts
- `simultaneous_edit` - Multiple users editing same file

## Performance Considerations

- Activity history limited to 50 items to prevent memory issues
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo and proper dependency arrays
- WebSocket connection pooling and automatic reconnection
- Debounced presence updates to reduce server load
