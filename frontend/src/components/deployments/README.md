<DeploymentCard
  deployment={deployment}
  onViewLogs={(deployment) => setSelectedDeployment(deployment)}
  onViewPreview={(deployment) => window.open(deployment.url, '_blank')}
  onRetry={(deployment) => retryDeployment(deployment.id)}
  onCancel={(deployment) => cancelDeployment(deployment.id)}
/>
```

### Preview Modal
```tsx
import { PreviewModal } from './components/deployments/PreviewModal';

<PreviewModal
  isOpen={showPreview}
  onClose={() => setShowPreview(false)}
  deployment={selectedDeployment}
/>
```

### Logs Viewer
```tsx
import { DeploymentLogsModal } from './components/deployments/DeploymentLogsModal';

<DeploymentLogsModal
  isOpen={showLogs}
  onClose={() => setShowLogs(false)}

  onRefresh={(deployment) => refreshLogs(deployment.id)}
/>
```

### Dashboard Widget
```tsx
import { DeploymentStatusWidget } from './components/deployments/DeploymentStatusWidget';

<DeploymentStatusWidget
