# Requirements Document

## Introduction

**Ticolops** - *"Track. Collaborate. Deploy. Succeed."*

Ticolops (Ticket Collaboration + Operations) is a web application designed to enhance project collaboration among students by providing real-time visibility into team member activities and automated DevOps integration. Similar to Plane's project management approach, the platform allows students to see exactly where their teammates are working at any given moment, while automatically handling deployment and sharing of their connected repositories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student team member, I want to see real-time status of where my teammates are working, so that I can coordinate effectively and avoid conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a team member is actively working on a specific file or component THEN the system SHALL display their current location and activity status to all team members
2. WHEN a team member goes idle for more than 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL update their status to "away" 
3. WHEN multiple team members are working on related components THEN the system SHALL highlight potential collaboration opportunities or conflicts
4. IF a team member is working on a critical path item THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the priority level to other team members

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to connect my repository to the platform, so that my work is automatically integrated and visible to my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I connect a Git repository to the platform THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and track my commits and branch activities
2. WHEN I push code to my repository THEN the system SHALL trigger automated DevOps processes within 2 minutes
3. IF the repository connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN I disconnect a repository THEN the system SHALL safely remove all associated automated processes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to access live previews of my teammates' work, so that I can provide feedback and stay aligned with project progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automated DevOps processes complete successfully THEN the system SHALL generate a shareable preview link
2. WHEN I click on a teammate's preview link THEN the system SHALL display their latest deployed version within 3 seconds
3. IF a deployment fails THEN the system SHALL show the last successful deployment with a clear indication of the failure
4. WHEN a new deployment is available THEN the system SHALL notify relevant team members automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project coordinator, I want to create and manage student project teams, so that I can organize collaboration effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new project THEN the system SHALL allow me to invite students via email or username
2. WHEN students join a project THEN the system SHALL automatically set up their collaboration workspace
3. IF a student leaves a project THEN the system SHALL safely transfer or archive their contributions
4. WHEN project settings are updated THEN the system SHALL notify all team members of the changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want to receive notifications about important team activities, so that I can stay informed without constantly monitoring the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teammate starts working on a component I'm interested in THEN the system SHALL send me a real-time notification
2. WHEN a deployment succeeds or fails THEN the system SHALL notify the repository owner and interested team members
3. IF there are merge conflicts or integration issues THEN the system SHALL alert relevant team members immediately
4. WHEN I'm mentioned in comments or discussions THEN the system SHALL send me a notification within 30 seconds

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student, I want the platform to handle DevOps tasks automatically, so that I can focus on coding rather than deployment configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I connect a repository THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the project type and configure appropriate build processes
2. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically build, test, and deploy the application
3. IF the automated process encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and suggested fixes
4. WHEN deployment is successful THEN the system SHALL update the preview link and notify team members
