CI/CD pipeline templates were added to build, test, and deploy images to a container registry.

  - Create backup and disaster recovery procedures — daily automated database backups, periodic snapshot testing, documented restore steps, and a runbook for failover and recovery scenarios; secrets and config are versioned and reproducible to aid recovery.
  - _Requirements: System security and reliability_
